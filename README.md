# Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project 1

This is my repository for the Coursera's course Exploratory Data Analysis. It includes 8 files for the Course Project 1, 4 plots in .png format and 4 R scripts to generate each of the plots, having the same names of the plots.

To run the scripts you have to:

1.    Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;   
2.    Download the data from the following link and extract it to the same directory where the scripts are:
[Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) [20Mb];
3.    Run the scripts.

The project assignment and the description of the data can be found here:
